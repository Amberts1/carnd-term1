## created to meet requirements of repository

This repository was created by Amber Roberts to contain the work for the Nanodegree Program for Self-Driving Cars

Difficulties have led to this desperate attempt to submit an initial assignment to receive formatting feedback and move forward with the refinement of my future submissions. Problems with importing cv2 and scheduling issues have led to a delay in my submission. I am hoping to get back on track this weekend.
